Day 3: Error Handling in Shell Scripting

In shell scripting, there is no try-catch. We handle errors using if-then or by checking the commandâ€™s success.

Problem:
Creating a folder that already exists will fail:

#!/bin/bash
function cr-dir() {
    mkdir demo
}
cr-dir
echo "this should not work"


1st run: works fine.

2nd run: mkdir: demo: File exists

Fixed version using if:

#!/bin/bash
function cr-dir() {
    mkdir demo
}

if ! cr-dir; then
    echo "Directory 'demo' already exists or could not be created."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Directory 'demo' was created successfully."


The if ! cr-dir checks if the command fails.

The exit 1 stops the script on error.

The success message only prints if the folder is created.
